This project provides a foundational infrastructure for creating pipelines with AWS CDK using *cdk pipelines*. The primary focus is on streamlining the deployment process for ECS tasks within the AWS ecosystem. By leveraging AWS CDK, developers can efficiently build, deploy, and manage containerized applications on Amazon ECS.

## Features

- **AWS CDK Integration**: Seamlessly integrate AWS CDK into your pipeline setup for infrastructure as code.
- **CDK Pipelines**: Utilize cdk pipelines to automate the deployment process and maintain pipeline infrastructures.
- **ECS Task Deployment**: Simplify the deployment of ECS tasks on AWS, ensuring efficient containerized application management.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Embrace the power of infrastructure as code principles to maintain consistency and repeatability in your deployments.
- **Customization**: Tailor the pipeline setup and ECS task deployments to suit your specific application requirements.
